# Claude Code Skills

Skills are reusable knowledge modules that provide domain-specific patterns, best practices, and implementation guidance.

## Available Skills

### GUI Development

| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [gui-threading](gui-threading/) | Framework-agnostic GUI threading | Any multithreaded GUI |
| [python-qt-gui](python-qt-gui/) | Python/Qt specific patterns | PySide6/PyQt6 apps |

**Relationship:** `python-qt-gui` extends `gui-threading`. Read the base skill first.

### Megamind Reasoning

| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [megamind-deep](megamind-deep/) | Systematic analysis, multiple approaches, risk assessment | Complex or ambiguous problems |
| [megamind-creative](megamind-creative/) | Structured creative chaos — pattern-mining, mutation, analogies, compression | Creative tasks, hard problems, when conventional approaches fail |
| [megamind-adversarial](megamind-adversarial/) | Red-team — attack the obvious approach, stress-test | When you need to find weaknesses |

**Auto-selected:** `megamind-deep`, `megamind-creative`. The adversarial variant is opt-in.

#### Benchmark Results (Opus 4.6, 30 challenges, 5 runs each)

The megamind skills are evaluated against a benchmark suite of 30 challenges across 6 categories. Each challenge has a rubric with required elements and anti-patterns, scored by a Claude-as-judge pipeline.

**Overall Performance:**

| Mode | Avg Score | Pass Rate | Variance | Delta vs Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (no skill) | 5.0 | 62% | high | — |
| megamind-deep | 6.7 | 82% | low | +1.7 |
| megamind-creative | 6.4 | 78% | low | +1.4 |
| megamind-adversarial | 6.5 | 80% | low | +1.5 |

**Per-Category Breakdown (best mode bolded):**

| Category | Challenges | Baseline | Deep | Creative | Adversarial | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| adversarial | 5 | 6.5 | 7.5 | 7.6 | **7.7** | adversarial |
| arch | 5 | 6.2 | **7.3** | 6.5 | 6.6 | deep |
| creative | 5 | 4.7 | 7.0 | **8.0** | 7.0 | creative |
| cross | 5 | 9.0 | **9.5** | 9.0 | 9.3 | deep |
| deep | 5 | 5.6 | **7.0** | 6.6 | 6.9 | deep |
| scope | 5 | 1.4 | 2.4 | 1.8 | **2.6** | adversarial |

**Key findings:**
- Each skill dominates its target category (creative on creative tasks, adversarial on adversarial tasks, deep on arch/deep/cross)
- All skills dramatically reduce variance vs baseline — more consistent results
- Scope challenges expose a fundamental weakness: Opus jumps to solutions instead of asking clarifying questions for vague prompts, even with skills active
- Cross-cutting challenges (stakeholder conflicts, incident response) score highest across all modes

**Running the benchmark:**

```bash
# Full run (30 challenges x 4 modes x 5 runs = 600 combos)
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --local --workers 24 --runs 5 --save results/output.json

# Single challenge smoke test
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --local --workers 1 --runs 1 --challenges arch-001

# Specific skill only (always includes baseline)
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --local --skill megamind-deep --runs 3

# Compare against saved baseline
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --local --runs 5 --save results/new.json --compare results/old.json

# API mode (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --runs 2
```

#### Challenge Categories

Challenges are YAML files in `tests/challenges/`. Each defines a prompt, required rubric elements, anti-patterns, and a passing score.

| Category | Count | Elements | Anti-patterns | Passing | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| adversarial | 5 | 8 | 3 | 6 | Red-teaming designs (caching, auth, feature flags, migrations, pipelines) |
| arch | 5 | 8 | 3 | 6 | Architecture decisions under ambiguity (DR strategy, build vs buy, event-driven, API gateway) |
| creative | 5 | 8 | 3 | 6 | Creative problem-solving (rate limiting, CLI redesign, onboarding, alert fatigue, code review) |
| cross | 5 | 10 | 3 | 7 | Cross-cutting concerns (stakeholder conflicts, incidents, security breaches, tech debt) |
| deep | 5 | 8 | 3 | 6 | Deep reasoning (DB migration, refactoring, API design, testing strategy, zero-downtime deploys) |
| scope | 5 | 6 | 2 | 4 | Scope clarification for vague requests ("make it faster", "fix search", "improve UX") |

### Specialized Domains

| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [clickhouse-io](clickhouse-io/) | ClickHouse analytics patterns | Data engineering |

## Skill Structure

Each skill directory contains:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md    # Main skill content (required)
└── README.md   # Documentation (optional)
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description for skill discovery
extends: base-skill  # Optional: for extension skills
---

# Skill Title

Skill content with patterns, examples, checklists...
```

## How Skills Work

1. **Activation**: Skills are loaded based on context (project type, file patterns, explicit request)
2. **Content**: Provides patterns, code examples, checklists, anti-patterns
3. **Rules**: Skills often pair with rules files for non-negotiable constraints

## Skill vs Rule

| Aspect | Skill | Rule |
|--------|-------|------|
| Purpose | Guidance, patterns | Constraints, mandates |
| Tone | "Here's how to..." | "You MUST/MUST NOT..." |
| Flexibility | Multiple valid approaches | Non-negotiable |
| Location | `.claude/skills/` | `.claude/rules/` |

## Learned Skills

Patterns extracted from sessions via `/learn`. Organized by category:

```
skills/learned/
├── python/          # Python-specific patterns
├── debugging/       # Debugging techniques
└── <category>/      # Any category
    └── <pattern>.md
```

- **Shared** (`skills/learned/<cat>/`): Deployed to projects via `setup.py`, synced across machines
- **Project-local** (`<project>/.claude/skills/learned-local/<cat>/`): Project-specific, not managed by setup.py

Use `/recall` to list or search learned skills. Use `/learn` to extract new patterns.

Categories are selected during `setup.py init` — projects only get relevant categories.

## Creating New Skills

1. Create directory: `.claude/skills/my-skill/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
3. Add `README.md` for documentation
4. If it has non-negotiables, create matching rule in `.claude/rules/`

### Extension Skills

For framework-specific implementations:

```yaml
---
name: framework-specific-skill
extends: base-skill
---
```

Start content with: "This skill extends `base-skill`. Read that first."

## GUI Threading Skills

The `gui-threading` and `python-qt-gui` skills are based on:

- **MIT 6.005**: Thread safety strategies
- **KDAB**: Eight Rules of Multithreaded Qt
- **Facebook Flux**: Unidirectional data flow
- **Redux**: Immutable state management
- **Martin Fowler**: Event sourcing patterns

Key patterns:
- UI thread protection (no backend work)
- One-way data flow (Backend → Controller → Model → View)
- Worker job pattern (signals, cancellation)
- Immutable snapshots (frozen dataclass + tuple)
- Debounced event-driven refresh
- Multipane dock layouts

See [gui-threading/README.md](gui-threading/README.md) for details.
