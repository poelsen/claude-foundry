# Claude Code Skills

Skills are reusable knowledge modules that provide domain-specific patterns, best practices, and implementation guidance.

> **Skill groups in `setup.py init`:** Megamind Reasoning (4 skills) and Project Management (6 skills) are toggled as groups, not individually. The 7 `copilot-*` skills are hidden from the menu and gated on the `copilot-mcp` MCP server selection — selecting the MCP auto-installs all 7, deselecting strips them. See the top-level [README — Skill Selection](../README.md#skill-selection-groups-hidden-skills-gating) section for details.

## Available Skills

### GUI Development

| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [gui-threading](gui-threading/) | Framework-agnostic GUI threading | Any multithreaded GUI |
| [python-qt-gui](python-qt-gui/) | Python/Qt specific patterns | PySide6/PyQt6 apps |

**Relationship:** `python-qt-gui` extends `gui-threading`. Read the base skill first.

### Megamind Reasoning

| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [megamind-deep](megamind-deep/) | Systematic analysis, multiple approaches, risk assessment | Complex or ambiguous problems |
| [megamind-creative](megamind-creative/) | Structured creative chaos — pattern-mining, mutation, analogies, compression | Creative tasks, hard problems, when conventional approaches fail |
| [megamind-adversarial](megamind-adversarial/) | Red-team — attack the obvious approach, stress-test | When you need to find weaknesses |
| [megamind-financial](megamind-financial/) | Multi-domain financial analysis — investment valuation (Thorleif Jackson methodology), DK/DE tax planning, mortgage, pension, insurance | Stock valuation, tax optimization, loan analysis, retirement planning |

**Auto-selected:** `megamind-deep`, `megamind-creative`. The adversarial and financial variants are opt-in.

The `megamind-financial` skill uses country-specific data files in `data/` (e.g., `dk-tax-2026.md`). See [IMPROVEMENT-PROCESS.md](IMPROVEMENT-PROCESS.md) for the annual DK tax data update procedure.

#### Benchmark Results (Opus 4.6, 30 challenges, 5 runs each)

The megamind skills are evaluated against a benchmark suite of 30 challenges across 6 categories. Each challenge has a rubric with required elements and anti-patterns, scored by a Claude-as-judge pipeline.

**Overall Performance:**

| Mode | Avg Score | Pass Rate | Variance | Delta vs Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (no skill) | 5.0 | 62% | high | — |
| megamind-deep | 6.7 | 82% | low | +1.7 |
| megamind-creative | 6.4 | 78% | low | +1.4 |
| megamind-adversarial | 6.5 | 80% | low | +1.5 |

**Per-Category Breakdown (best mode bolded):**

| Category | Challenges | Baseline | Deep | Creative | Adversarial | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| adversarial | 5 | 6.5 | 7.5 | 7.6 | **7.7** | adversarial |
| arch | 5 | 6.2 | **7.3** | 6.5 | 6.6 | deep |
| creative | 5 | 4.7 | 7.0 | **8.0** | 7.0 | creative |
| cross | 5 | 9.0 | **9.5** | 9.0 | 9.3 | deep |
| deep | 5 | 5.6 | **7.0** | 6.6 | 6.9 | deep |
| scope | 5 | 1.4 | 2.4 | 1.8 | **2.6** | adversarial |

**Key findings:**
- Each skill dominates its target category (creative on creative tasks, adversarial on adversarial tasks, deep on arch/deep/cross)
- All skills dramatically reduce variance vs baseline — more consistent results
- Scope challenges expose a fundamental weakness: Opus jumps to solutions instead of asking clarifying questions for vague prompts, even with skills active
- Cross-cutting challenges (stakeholder conflicts, incident response) score highest across all modes

**Running the benchmark** (requires `claude` CLI authenticated and in PATH):

```bash
# Full run (76 challenges x 5 modes x 5 runs = 3800 combos)
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --workers 24 --runs 5 --save results/output.json

# Single challenge smoke test
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --workers 1 --runs 1 --challenges arch-001

# Specific skill only (always includes baseline)
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --skill megamind-deep --runs 3

# Compare against saved baseline
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --runs 5 --save results/new.json --compare results/old.json
```

#### Challenge Categories

Challenges are YAML files in `tests/challenges/`. Each defines a prompt, required rubric elements, anti-patterns, and a passing score.

| Category | Count | Elements | Anti-patterns | Passing | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| adversarial | 5 | 8 | 3 | 6 | Red-teaming designs (caching, auth, feature flags, migrations, pipelines) |
| arch | 5 | 8 | 3 | 6 | Architecture decisions under ambiguity (DR strategy, build vs buy, event-driven, API gateway) |
| creative | 5 | 8 | 3 | 6 | Creative problem-solving (rate limiting, CLI redesign, onboarding, alert fatigue, code review) |
| cross | 5 | 10 | 3 | 7 | Cross-cutting concerns (stakeholder conflicts, incidents, security breaches, tech debt) |
| deep | 5 | 8 | 3 | 6 | Deep reasoning (DB migration, refactoring, API design, testing strategy, zero-downtime deploys) |
| financial | 20 | 8 | 3 | 6 | Financial analysis (valuation, Thorleif scoring, data quality, cyclicals, REITs, portfolio construction) |
| scope | 5 | 6 | 2 | 4 | Scope clarification for vague requests ("make it faster", "fix search", "improve UX") |

### Validation Methodology

Skill benchmark scores are produced by LLM-as-judge evaluation (Claude scoring Claude's output against YAML rubrics). These scores measure rubric compliance and structural quality, **not human-expert-validated correctness**. The scores are useful for:
- Regression testing (did a skill change break something?)
- Comparative ranking (does the skill outperform baseline on its own domain?)
- Iterative improvement (which rubric elements does the skill miss?)

The scores should NOT be interpreted as:
- Professional-quality validation of financial, legal, or medical advice
- Correlation with domain expert judgment (this has not been measured)
- Proof that skill responses are "correct" in any absolute sense

Real-world validation comes from usage by software engineers who report that the skills produce qualitatively better analysis, more thorough risk identification, and more actionable recommendations than unguided prompts. This is anecdotal and experience-based, not statistically measured.

### Specialized Domains

| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [clickhouse-io](clickhouse-io/) | ClickHouse analytics patterns | Data engineering |

### Copilot MCP (Opt-in)

Route Claude Code tasks to VS Code Copilot models (Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.4, Gemini 3.1, Grok, etc.) via an MCP bridge — saves Anthropic API tokens by using your existing Copilot subscription. **Disabled by default.** Enable by selecting `copilot-mcp` in the MCP-servers toggle during `setup.py init`, which pulls in these skills and installs the VS Code extension (pre-built .vsix from the release tarball, or rebuilt from source as a fallback).

> **⚠ Runtime requirements — every time you use a `/copilot-*` command:**
> VS Code must be running **with the project folder open as a workspace**, Claude Code must be launched from within that workspace tree, and the workspace's `.vscode/settings.json` must contain `{ "copilot-mcp.autoStart": true }` — the extension is installed machine-wide but **idle by default** and only starts in workspaces you explicitly opt in.

| Skill | Purpose | Command |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [copilot-list-models](copilot-list-models/) | List available Copilot models | `/copilot-list-models` |
| [copilot-ask](copilot-ask/) | One-shot prompt to any model | `/copilot-ask <model> <prompt>` |
| [copilot-review](copilot-review/) | Code review via Copilot | `/copilot-review [model] [target]` |
| [copilot-audit](copilot-audit/) | Adversarial audit | `/copilot-audit [skill] [model] [target]` |
| [copilot-agent](copilot-agent/) | Autonomous agent loop | `/copilot-agent [model] [session:name] <task>` |
| [copilot-multi](copilot-multi/) | Fan-out to multiple models | `/copilot-multi [models:list] <task>` |
| [copilot-job](copilot-job/) | Background job management | `/copilot-job [start\|status\|list] <args>` |

Requires VS Code + GitHub Copilot subscription. Extension auto-rebuilds on `/update-foundry` when prereqs (`code`, `node`, `npm`) are present. See the top-level [README — Copilot MCP section](../README.md#copilot-mcp-opt-in) for usage examples and troubleshooting.

### Project Management

Named project contexts let you work on multiple parallel initiatives without losing state. Each project lives in `.claude/prjs/<name>.md` with goals, status, decisions, and key files.

| Skill | Purpose | Command |
|-------|---------|---------|
| [prj-new](prj-new/) | Create a new named project | `/prj-new <name>` |
| [prj-list](prj-list/) | List all projects with status | `/prj-list` |
| [prj-pause](prj-pause/) | Save session state, mark paused | `/prj-pause <name>` |
| [prj-resume](prj-resume/) | Load project context, resume work | `/prj-resume <name>` |
| [prj-done](prj-done/) | Mark project complete | `/prj-done <name>` |
| [prj-delete](prj-delete/) | Delete a project file | `/prj-delete <name>` |

The script-based prj-* skills share [`_lib/session-id.sh`](_lib/session-id.sh) to detect the current Claude session and record it on pause, so `/prj-resume` can suggest `--resume <session_id>`.

**Auto-selected:** All prj-* skills are installed by default via `setup.py`.

## Skill Structure

Each skill directory contains:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md    # Main skill content (required)
└── README.md   # Documentation (optional)
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description for skill discovery
extends: base-skill  # Optional: for extension skills
---

# Skill Title

Skill content with patterns, examples, checklists...
```

## How Skills Work

1. **Activation**: Skills are loaded based on context (project type, file patterns, explicit request)
2. **Content**: Provides patterns, code examples, checklists, anti-patterns
3. **Rules**: Skills often pair with rules files for non-negotiable constraints

## Skill vs Rule

| Aspect | Skill | Rule |
|--------|-------|------|
| Purpose | Guidance, patterns | Constraints, mandates |
| Tone | "Here's how to..." | "You MUST/MUST NOT..." |
| Flexibility | Multiple valid approaches | Non-negotiable |
| Location | `.claude/skills/` | `.claude/rules/` |

## Learned Skills

Patterns extracted from sessions via `/learn`. Organized by category:

```
skills/learned/
├── python/          # Python-specific patterns
├── debugging/       # Debugging techniques
└── <category>/      # Any category
    └── <pattern>.md
```

- **Shared** (`skills/learned/<cat>/`): Deployed to projects via `setup.py`, synced across machines
- **Project-local** (`<project>/.claude/skills/learned-local/<cat>/`): Project-specific, not managed by setup.py

Use `/recall` to list or search learned skills. Use `/learn` to extract new patterns.

Categories are selected during `setup.py init` — projects only get relevant categories.

## Creating New Skills

1. Create directory: `.claude/skills/my-skill/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
3. Add `README.md` for documentation
4. If it has non-negotiables, create matching rule in `.claude/rules/`

### Extension Skills

For framework-specific implementations:

```yaml
---
name: framework-specific-skill
extends: base-skill
---
```

Start content with: "This skill extends `base-skill`. Read that first."

## GUI Threading Skills

The `gui-threading` and `python-qt-gui` skills are based on:

- **MIT 6.005**: Thread safety strategies
- **KDAB**: Eight Rules of Multithreaded Qt
- **Facebook Flux**: Unidirectional data flow
- **Redux**: Immutable state management
- **Martin Fowler**: Event sourcing patterns

Key patterns:
- UI thread protection (no backend work)
- One-way data flow (Backend → Controller → Model → View)
- Worker job pattern (signals, cancellation)
- Immutable snapshots (frozen dataclass + tuple)
- Debounced event-driven refresh
- Multipane dock layouts

See [gui-threading/README.md](gui-threading/README.md) for details.
