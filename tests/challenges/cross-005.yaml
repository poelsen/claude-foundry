name: "Technical Debt Prioritization Under Pressure"
category: cross_cutting
prompt: |
  You're the tech lead. Budget: 1 engineer-month to address technical debt. Three candidates:
  1. Test coverage: Core payment service has 0% test coverage. It breaks in production
     about once a week, requiring 2-4 hours of manual fixing each time.
  2. Scaling bottleneck: The recommendation engine uses an O(n^2) algorithm. Currently
     handles 10k products fine, but the catalog is growing 20%/month. At current growth,
     it'll timeout at ~50k products (roughly 6 months from now).
  3. Security vulnerability: A deprecated authentication library has a known CVE
     (CVSS 7.5). No known exploits in the wild yet, but it's in the NVD.
  Pick one. Justify why the other two can wait.
rubric:
  required_elements:
    systematic_triage: "Uses a structured framework (risk x impact x urgency) for prioritization"
    analyzes_all_three: "Provides substantive analysis of each debt item, not just the chosen one"
    quantifies_impact: "Uses the given numbers to calculate costs (e.g., weekly hours lost, months to failure)"
    timeline_assessment: "Assesses when each problem becomes critical"
    risk_calibration: "Distinguishes between current impact and future risk for each item"
    considers_dependencies: "Considers whether fixing one helps or blocks fixing others"
    justifies_deferrals: "Explicitly justifies why the unchosen items can wait with specific reasoning"
    mitigation_for_deferred: "Proposes stopgap measures for the items not chosen"
    recommends_clearly: "Makes a clear, defensible choice with explicit reasoning"
    acknowledges_uncertainty: "Acknowledges what could change the priority (e.g., exploit published)"
  anti_patterns:
    picks_without_analysis: "Picks one without analyzing the others"
    refuses_to_choose: "Tries to do all three or refuses to prioritize"
    ignores_numbers: "Doesn't use the provided quantitative data in the analysis"
