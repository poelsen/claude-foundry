name: "Legacy System Rewrite Stakeholder Conflict"
category: cross_cutting
prompt: |
  You're leading the backend team. The situation:
  - VP of Engineering wants a full rewrite from Python to Go for "performance and hiring"
  - Your team estimates 18 months for the rewrite, during which feature work stops
  - Sales has already promised a key client three new features shipping in 3 months
  - Finance flagged that the current system has a 0.3% transaction error rate costing ~$50k/month
  - The Python codebase is 8 years old, has some tech debt, but works
  - Your team of 6 is split: 3 want the rewrite, 3 want to keep iterating
  What do you recommend?

    timeline_reality: "Addresses the 18-month estimate vs 3-month sales commitment conflict"
    error_rate_analysis: "Analyzes whether the 0.3% error rate is a rewrite problem or a fixable bug"
    team_dynamics: "Addresses the team split and morale implications"
    risk_assessment: "Identifies risks of each approach (rewrite fails, clients churn, talent leaves)"
    quantifies_impact: "Uses the $50k/month and other numbers to support analysis"
    recommends_with_nuance: "Makes a clear recommendation while acknowledging tradeoffs"
    escalation_criteria: "Defines decision points or milestones for revisiting the approach"
  anti_patterns:
    picks_side: "Immediately picks rewrite or keep-iterating without analysis"
    ignores_stakeholder: "Ignores one or more stakeholder perspectives"
