  We need an admin dashboard for our customer support team. Options on the table:
  1. Extend our existing React app with admin pages
  2. Use Django Admin (our backend is Django)
  3. Buy Retool or similar low-code platform
  We have 6 weeks, a team of 2 (one backend, one frontend), and the dashboard needs
  to handle CRUD for users, orders, and subscriptions plus some custom workflows
  (refunds, account merges). What should we do?

    timeline_analysis: "Assesses whether 6 weeks is realistic for each option"
    custom_workflow_fit: "Specifically addresses how each option handles refunds/account merges"
    total_cost_ownership: "Considers ongoing maintenance cost, not just build cost"
    asks_clarification: "Asks about usage patterns, user count, or future requirements"
