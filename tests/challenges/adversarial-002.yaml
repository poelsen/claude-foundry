prompt: |
  The team wants to break our Django monolith into microservices. The plan:
  1. Extract the user service first (auth, profiles, preferences)
  2. Use REST between services
  3. Share the database initially, split later
  4. Deploy on Kubernetes
  Timeline: 3 months. Team: 4 engineers.
  Stress-test this plan.
