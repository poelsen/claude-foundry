  Add real-time notifications to our Django app. Users should get notified

  required_elements:
    identifies_assumptions: "Lists assumptions about scale, notification types, delivery channels"
    considers_alternatives: "Mentions at least 2 architectural approaches (e.g., WebSockets vs SSE vs polling)"
    identifies_risks: "Discusses what could go wrong (scale, reliability, cost)"
    asks_clarification: "Asks before committing to an approach"
    considers_existing: "Considers existing infrastructure and constraints"
    proposes_phased_approach: "Suggests incremental rollout or phased implementation"
    considers_monitoring: "Mentions observability, monitoring, or metrics for the new system"
    quantifies_tradeoffs: "Provides concrete comparisons (latency, cost, complexity) not just vague pros/cons"
  anti_patterns:
    jumps_to_code: "Immediately writes implementation code"
    single_solution: "Only considers one approach without alternatives"
    ignores_scale: "Doesn't consider the 50k DAU constraint"
