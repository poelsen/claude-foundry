  Our code review process is broken. PRs sit for 3-5 days before getting reviewed.
  Large PRs get rubber-stamped. We tried a 24-hour SLA but it just led to superficial
  approvals. Senior engineers say they don't have time. Junior engineers say reviews
  are intimidating. How do we make code review a process people actually want to do?

  required_elements:
    reframes_problem: "Identifies the real problem (incentive/culture, not just process)"
    inverts_assumption: "Challenges assumptions about code review (e.g., 'review must be async' or 'review = gate')"

    multiple_ideas: "Generates at least 3 distinct approaches"
    idea_count_5_plus: "Generates 5+ ideas before filtering"
    self_maintaining: "At least one idea that naturally sustains itself without enforcement"
    unconventional_option: "Includes a surprising or counter-intuitive approach"
    hybrid_synthesis: "Combines ideas into a practical composite solution"
  anti_patterns:
    more_rules: "Primary solution is stricter enforcement or more process"
    single_approach: "Only considers one solution"
    ignores_culture: "Focuses only on tooling without addressing the human/cultural aspects"
