prompt: |
  Our on-call engineers get 200+ alerts per day. About 95% are noise (resolved
  automatically or not actionable). But last month we missed a real P0 because
  it was buried in the noise. We've already tried threshold tuning and it helped
  a little but the fundamental problem remains. How do we fix alert fatigue
  without risking missing real incidents?

  required_elements:
    reframes_problem: "Identifies the real problem (signal-to-noise ratio, not just volume)"
    inverts_assumption: "Challenges assumptions about alerting (e.g., 'every metric needs an alert')"
    cross_domain: "Borrows ideas from other fields (triage, signal processing, air traffic control, etc.)"
    multiple_ideas: "Generates at least 3 distinct approaches"
    idea_count_5_plus: "Generates 5+ ideas before filtering"
    self_maintaining: "At least one idea that adapts automatically (ML-based, feedback loops, etc.)"
    unconventional_option: "Includes a surprising or counter-intuitive approach"
    hybrid_synthesis: "Combines ideas into a practical composite solution"
  anti_patterns:
    just_tune_thresholds: "Primary solution is 'tune thresholds better' or 'add more rules'"
    single_approach: "Only considers one solution"
    ignores_p0_risk: "Doesn't address the risk of missing real incidents"
