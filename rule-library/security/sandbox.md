# Security: Sandbox/Personal Projects

Relaxed security for experimentation and personal projects.

## Minimum Checks
- [ ] No real credentials committed (use dummy values)
- [ ] No secrets in git history

## Allowed Shortcuts
- Hardcoded test values OK
- Self-signed certs OK
- Debug endpoints OK
- Detailed error messages OK

## Focus
Rapid iteration over security hardening. Fix security before publishing.
