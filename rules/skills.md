# Learned Skills

When stuck on a problem, check for relevant learned patterns before searching externally:

1. `.claude/skills/learned/` — shared patterns deployed from claude_config
2. `.claude/skills/learned-local/` — project-specific patterns

Use `/recall` to list or search learned skills.
Use `/learn` to extract new patterns from the current session.
