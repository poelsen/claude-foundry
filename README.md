# Claude Code Foundry

> **Early alpha.** Under active development. The current rule set is most mature for **Python** and **PySide6/Qt** projects. Other languages (C, C++, Rust, Go, TypeScript) have base rules but are less battle-tested. Expect breaking changes.

A framework for configuring [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) across different project types and programming languages. Provides modular rules, specialized agents, reusable skills, tool hooks, and slash commands — all selected per-project based on what you're building.

## Bootstrap

Requires Python 3.11+. No external dependencies.

### Option A: Download a release

Download the latest tarball from the [Releases page](https://github.com/poelsen/claude-foundry/releases) and extract it:

```bash
tar xzf claude-foundry-*.tar.gz
cd claude-foundry-*
python3 tools/setup.py init /path/to/your/project
```

### Option B: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/poelsen/claude-foundry.git
cd claude-foundry
python3 tools/setup.py init /path/to/your/project
```

### What `setup.py init` does

1. Scans your project for languages (file extensions, config files like `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`)
2. Presents interactive toggle menus for each component category:
   - **Base rules** — coding style, security, testing, git workflow, etc.
   - **Modular rules** — language tooling, project templates, platform, security
   - **Hooks** — language-specific formatters and type checkers
   - **Agents** — specialized sub-agents matched to your languages
   - **Skills** — domain knowledge modules
   - **Plugins** — LSP servers, workflow plugins
3. Copies selected files into your project's `.claude/` directory
4. Saves selections to `.claude/setup-manifest.json` for future updates

## Updating

From any configured project, run the `/update-foundry` slash command inside a Claude Code session:

```
/update-foundry                # Check for new release, download, and apply
/update-foundry-check          # Just check if an update is available
/update-foundry-interactive    # Full interactive menu to add/change selections
```

`/update-foundry` checks the GitHub releases API, downloads the latest tarball to **`<project>/.foundry/foundry.tar.gz`**, refreshes the sibling `setup.py`, and runs it non-interactively using the saved manifest. Works the same regardless of how you bootstrapped.

### Where foundry lives after install

Every project gets a self-contained payload at:

```
<project>/.foundry/                  # gitignored
├── setup.py                         # extracted from the tarball below
└── foundry.tar.gz                   # the pinned release
```

That's all. Nothing under `.claude/` belongs to foundry's machinery — `.claude/` only contains the artifacts foundry installed for *this project* (commands, skills, agents, rules, hooks). When `setup.py` runs, it detects the sibling tarball, extracts it to a tempdir for the duration of the run, and wipes the tempdir on exit — so Claude never trips over a duplicate copy of the foundry tree while traversing your project.

**Why per-project?** Different projects can be on different foundry versions, and `setup.py` is always matched to the tarball next to it. No user-level cache, no symlinks — one self-contained payload per project. The original bootstrap tarball you downloaded can be deleted as soon as the first install completes; `.foundry/` carries forward.

On every `/update-foundry`, the tarball is replaced atomically (staged as `.foundry/foundry.tar.gz.new`, swapped via `mv` only after a successful setup run; rolled back on failure).

### Manual re-init

To re-run setup.py manually (e.g. to toggle new skill groups, register a private source, or reconfigure):

```bash
python3 <project>/.foundry/setup.py init <project>
```

The post-init summary prints this exact command so you can copy-paste it from your terminal.

For batch updates across all known projects:

```bash
python3 <project>/.foundry/setup.py update-all
```

## CLAUDE.md Convention

When `setup.py init` runs, it handles `CLAUDE.md` intelligently:

### For new projects (no CLAUDE.md)

Creates a minimal `CLAUDE.md` with a **claude-foundry header** containing:
- List of deployed rules with descriptions
- Environment commands for detected languages (setup, test, lint)
- Pointers to `codemaps/INDEX.md` for architecture
- Documentation conventions

### For existing projects

If `CLAUDE.md` already exists, setup.py offers three options:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Replace** | Generate new CLAUDE.md, save original as `CLAUDE.md.old` |
| **Merge** | Prepend claude-foundry header to existing, save original as `CLAUDE.md.old` |
| **Quit** | Abort setup entirely |

### Header updates

The claude-foundry header is wrapped in marker comments (`<!-- claude-foundry -->` ... `<!-- /claude-foundry -->`). On subsequent runs:
- If the marker exists, the header is **updated silently** with current rules/languages
- If no marker exists, setup.py asks before modifying (interactive) or skips (non-interactive)

### Best practices

- Keep `CLAUDE.md` minimal — just pointers and environment commands
- The header points Claude to the right places automatically

## Documentation Structure

Claude-foundry recommends a three-tier documentation approach:

| Location | Purpose | Maintained by |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Pointers and environment setup | claude-foundry (auto-updated) |
| `codemaps/` | Architecture overview per module | `/update-codemaps` (auto-generated) |
| `docs/` | Detailed project documentation | You (manual) |

### CLAUDE.md

Keep minimal. The claude-foundry header provides:
- Links to `.claude/rules/` for coding standards
- Environment commands (setup, test, lint)
- Pointer to `codemaps/INDEX.md`

Don't put detailed documentation here — it gets out of sync and wastes context.

### codemaps/

Auto-generated architecture docs. Run `/update-codemaps` to create/refresh. Each module gets:
- Purpose and responsibilities
- Key components with file:line references
- Public API surface
- Dependencies and data flow

Claude reads these before modifying unfamiliar code.

### docs/

Your detailed documentation:
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — design decisions, patterns, rationale
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` — setup guide, workflow, conventions
- `docs/API.md` — detailed API documentation

If you have existing documentation in `CLAUDE.md`, migrate it to `docs/` after running setup.py init

## Codemaps

Codemaps are auto-generated architecture documentation. Each module gets a markdown file describing key components, public APIs, dependencies, and data flow.

### Using codemaps

1. Run `/update-codemaps` to generate or refresh architecture docs
2. Files are created in `codemaps/` with an `INDEX.md` overview
3. The command checks staleness — only stale codemaps regenerate

### When to update

Run `/update-codemaps` after:
- Adding new modules or packages
- Changing public APIs
- Adding significant new dependencies

Claude automatically reads `codemaps/INDEX.md` before modifying unfamiliar modules (per the `codemaps.md` rule).

## What Gets Installed

Everything is copied into `<project>/.claude/`:

| Component | Source | What it does |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Rules** | `rules/` + `rule-library/` | Markdown files that instruct Claude on coding standards, security, git workflow, testing methodology |
| **Agents** | `agents/` | Specialized sub-agents for TDD, code review, security analysis, architecture design |
| **Commands** | `commands/` | Slash commands: `/snapshot`, `/learn`, `/learn-recall`, `/update-foundry`, `/update-codemaps` |
| **Skills** | `skills/` | Domain knowledge modules (GUI threading patterns, ClickHouse, learned patterns) |
| **Hooks** | `hooks/library/` | Shell scripts that run before/after Claude Code tool calls (formatters, type checkers) |
| **Plugins** | configured in `settings.json` | LSP servers and workflow plugins (feature-dev, PR review toolkit) |
| **Copilot CLI** | `skills/copilot-cli/` | Thin reference skill for the local GitHub Copilot CLI — lets review-process run non-Claude models (e.g. GPT-5.4). See [Copilot CLI](#copilot-cli). |

## Rules

Rules are markdown files loaded by Claude Code at session start. They shape how Claude writes code, handles errors, makes commits, and reviews changes.

**Base rules** (`rules/`) are recommended for all projects:

- `coding-style.md` — KISS/YAGNI/DRY, small functions, minimal diffs
- `git-workflow.md` — branch naming, commit message format, PR workflow
- `security.md` — mandatory security checks before commits
- `testing.md` — TDD workflow, 80% coverage target
- `architecture.md` — composition over inheritance, module boundaries
- `performance.md` — model selection strategy, context window management
- `agents.md` — when and how to use specialized sub-agents
- `codemaps.md` — architecture documentation system
- `hooks.md` — documents available hooks
- `skills.md` — points Claude to learned patterns when stuck

**Modular rules** (`rule-library/`) are selected per-project:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| `lang/` | Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, MATLAB |
| `templates/` | Embedded C, Embedded DSP, React App, REST API, Desktop GUI Qt, Library, Scripts, Data Pipeline, Monolith |
| `platform/` | GitHub (auto-detected) |
| `security/` | Sandbox, internal, enterprise |

## Commands

Slash commands are available inside Claude Code after running `setup.py init`:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/snapshot` | Captures current session state (task, decisions, files modified, next steps) to a snapshot file. |
| `/snapshot-list` | Lists all snapshots with date, goal, and status. |
| `/snapshot-restore` | Resumes from the most recent snapshot. |
| `/learn` | After solving a non-trivial problem, extracts the pattern into a reusable skill file. See [Learned Skills](#learned-skills). |
| `/learn-recall` | Lists or searches all learned skills. `/learn-recall python` searches for Python-related patterns. |
| `/update-foundry` | Checks GitHub for a newer release and applies it. See [Updating](#updating). |
| `/update-foundry-check` | Checks if an update is available without applying changes. |
| `/update-foundry-interactive` | Full interactive menu to add or change component selections. |
| `/update-codemaps` | Generates or refreshes architecture documentation per module. |
| `/review-process` | Runs a tiered review (risk-tier T0-T4, mode, reviewer routing, finding ledger). See [Review Process](#review-process). |
| `/private-list` | Lists registered private config sources with status. |
| `/private-remove` | Removes a private source by prefix. `/private-remove company` removes all `company-*` files. |
| `/prj-new <name>` | Creates a new named project in `.claude/prjs/<name>.md`. See [Project Management](#project-management). |
| `/prj-list` | Lists all named projects with status and resume commands. |
| `/prj-pause <name>` | Saves current session state and marks the project paused. |
| `/prj-resume <name>` | Loads a project's context and resumes work (suggests `--resume <session_id>`). |
| `/prj-done <name>` | Marks a project complete. |
| `/prj-delete <name>` | Deletes a project file. |

## Agents

Agents are specialized sub-agents that Claude Code launches for specific tasks. During `setup.py init`, agents are selected based on your project's languages.

| Agent | Purpose | Languages |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `architect-*` | System design and architectural decisions | Python, TypeScript |
| `tdd-guide-*` | Test-driven development (write tests first) | Python, TypeScript |
| `code-reviewer-*` | Code quality, security, maintainability review | Python, TypeScript |
| `security-reviewer-*` | OWASP scanning, vulnerability detection | Python, TypeScript |
| `build-error-resolver-*` | Fix build/lint/type errors with minimal diffs | Python, TypeScript |
| `e2e-test-*` | End-to-end browser or GUI testing | Python (Playwright + pytest-qt), TypeScript (Playwright) |
| `refactor-cleaner-*` | Dead code removal, consolidation | Python, TypeScript |
| `doc-updater` | Documentation and codemap updates | All |

## Hooks

Hooks are shell scripts that run automatically before or after Claude Code tool calls.

### What `setup.py` installs

`setup.py` writes hook entries into your project's `.claude/settings.json` based on detected languages. Only language-specific hooks from `hooks/library/` are installed:

| Hook script | Trigger | Language |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| `ruff-format.sh` | After editing `.py` files | Python |
| `mypy-check.sh` | After editing `.py` files | Python |
| `prettier-format.sh` | After editing `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.js`/`.jsx` files | JS/TS |
| `tsc-check.sh` | After editing `.ts`/`.tsx` files | TypeScript |
| `cargo-check.sh` | After editing `.rs` files | Rust |


## Skill Selection (groups, hidden skills, gating)

The skill menu in `setup.py init` presents related skills as **groups**, not individual toggles. Selecting a group toggles all its members together:

| Group | Members |
|-------|---------|
| **Megamind Reasoning** | `megamind-deep`, `megamind-creative`, `megamind-adversarial`, `megamind-financial` |
| **Project Management** | `prj-new`, `prj-list`, `prj-pause`, `prj-resume`, `prj-done`, `prj-delete` |

Both groups are **auto-selected by default**. Individual non-grouped skills (`clickhouse-io`, `gui-threading`, `learn`, `update-foundry`, `snapshot-list`, `private-list`, `private-remove`, `review-process`, `copilot-cli`, etc.) continue to appear as individual entries. A handful — `update-foundry`, `learn`, `learn-recall`, `snapshot-list`, `private-list`, `private-remove`, `review-process`, and `copilot-cli` — are auto-selected by default; the others are off until explicitly toggled on.

The manifest still stores individual skill names (not group names), so existing projects keep working without migration.

## Learned Skills

Claude Code sessions often produce solutions worth remembering. The `/learn` and `/recall` commands turn these into persistent, searchable knowledge.

### How it works

1. After solving a non-trivial problem, run `/learn`
2. Claude analyzes the session and drafts a skill file (problem → solution → example → when to use)
3. You pick a **category** (e.g. `python`, `debugging`, `pyside6`) and a **save location**:
   - **Claude-foundry repo** (default): `skills/learned/<category>/<name>.md` — commit and push to share across machines. Deployed to projects via `setup.py init`.
   - **Project-local**: `.claude/skills/learned-local/<category>/<name>.md` — stays in this project only.
4. When Claude gets stuck on a problem, it checks these directories automatically (via `rules/skills.md`)
5. Run `/recall` to list all learned skills, or `/recall <keyword>` to search

The `skills/learned/` directory starts empty. Categories are created as you learn patterns.

## Private Sources

Private sources let you add company-specific or team-specific rules, commands, skills, agents, and hooks alongside the public claude-foundry config. Register once, and they're automatically re-applied on every `/update-foundry`.

### Directory structure

A private source follows the same layout as claude-foundry:

```
my-company-config/
├── rule-library/          # Rules deployed to .claude/rules/
│   └── templates/
│       └── custom-dsp.md
├── commands/              # Optional slash commands
├── skills/                # Optional skill directories
├── agents/                # Optional agents
└── hooks/
    └── library/           # Optional hooks
```

### Registering a private source

**During interactive init:**
```bash
python3 tools/setup.py init /path/to/project
# ... normal setup ...
# Add a private config source? (path or Enter to skip): /path/to/company-config
# Prefix [company-config]: company
# ... toggle menu for available items ...
```

**Via CLI flags:**
```bash
python3 tools/setup.py init /path/to/project \
  --private /path/to/company-config --prefix company
```

Multiple sources can be registered. Files are deployed with the prefix to avoid collisions (e.g., `company-custom-dsp.md`).

### Managing private sources

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/private-list` | Show registered sources with deployed file counts |
| `/private-remove <prefix>` | Remove all files with that prefix and unregister |

### How it works

- Selections are saved in `setup-manifest.json` under `"private_sources"`
- `setup.py init --non-interactive` re-deploys from the manifest automatically
- `/update-foundry` calls `setup.py init --non-interactive`, so private sources survive updates
- Foundry's cleanup functions skip private-prefixed files
- Paths are absolute and machine-specific — each team member registers their own local path

## Releases

Every merge to `master` triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. Computes a [CalVer](https://calver.org/) version (`YYYY.MM.DD`, with `.N` suffix for same-day releases)
2. Creates a git tag
3. Builds a release tarball containing all deployable files
4. Publishes a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/poelsen/claude-foundry/releases) with the tarball attached

## Project Structure

```
claude-foundry/
├── rules/                    # Base rules (selected during init)

└── tools/setup.py            # Setup and deployment tool
```

## Megamind Skills

The megamind skills are reasoning enhancers that improve Claude's performance on complex tasks. Each mode targets a different thinking style.

### Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **megamind-deep** | Systematic analysis — surface assumptions, consider alternatives, assess risks | Architecture decisions, debugging, scope clarification |
| **megamind-creative** | Structured creative chaos — pattern-mining, analogies, constraint mutation | Creative problem-solving, brainstorming, unconventional solutions |
| **megamind-adversarial** | Red-team — attack the obvious approach, find failure modes, stress-test | Security review, design review, finding weaknesses |
| **megamind-financial** | Multi-domain financial analysis — investment valuation (Thorleif Jackson methodology), DK/DE tax planning, mortgage, pension, insurance | Stock valuation, tax optimization, loan/mortgage analysis, retirement planning |

`megamind-deep` and `megamind-creative` are auto-selected during `setup.py init`. The adversarial and financial variants are opt-in.

The `megamind-financial` skill uses country-specific data files in `skills/megamind-financial/data/` (e.g., `dk-tax-2026.md`). See [skills/IMPROVEMENT-PROCESS.md](skills/IMPROVEMENT-PROCESS.md) for the annual DK tax data update procedure.

### Benchmark (Opus 4.6, 30 challenges, 5 runs each)

Skills are evaluated using a Claude-as-judge benchmark. Each challenge has a rubric with required elements and anti-patterns. The judge scores each response and the benchmark reports hit rates, pass rates, and averages.

**Overall:**

| Mode | Avg Score | Pass Rate | Delta vs Baseline |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Baseline (no skill) | 5.0 | 62% | — |
| megamind-deep | 6.7 | 82% | +1.7 |
| megamind-creative | 6.4 | 78% | +1.4 |
| megamind-adversarial | 6.5 | 80% | +1.5 |

**Per-category winners:**

| Category | Description | Best Mode | Score |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| adversarial | Red-team designs (auth, caching, pipelines, feature flags) | adversarial | 7.7 |
| arch | Architecture under ambiguity (DR, build-vs-buy, event-driven, gateways) | deep | 7.3 |
| creative | Creative problem-solving (alert fatigue, code review, onboarding, CLI) | creative | 8.0 |
| cross | Cross-cutting (stakeholder conflicts, incidents, security breaches, tech debt) | deep | 9.5 |
| deep | Deep reasoning (DB migration, refactoring, API design, testing, deploys) | deep | 7.0 |
| scope | Scope clarification for vague requests ("make it faster", "fix search") | adversarial | 2.6 |

Each skill dominates its target category. Deep mode is the best all-rounder. Scope challenges expose a fundamental weakness — Opus jumps to solutions instead of asking clarifying questions for vague prompts, even with skills active.

### Challenge Format

Challenges are YAML files in `tests/challenges/`:

```yaml
id: arch-001
name: "Architecture Decision Under Ambiguity"
category: reasoning_depth
skill: megamind-deep
prompt: |
  Add real-time notifications to our Django app...
rubric:
  required_elements:
    identifies_assumptions: "Lists assumptions about scale, notification types"
    considers_alternatives: "Mentions at least 2 architectural approaches"
  anti_patterns:
    jumps_to_code: "Immediately writes implementation code"
  passing_score: 6
```

### Running the Benchmark

Requires the `claude` CLI authenticated and in PATH. Uses `--output-format json` and `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` for non-interactive / CI-compatible execution.

```bash
# Full run (76 challenges x 5 modes x 5 runs)
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --workers 24 --runs 5 --save results/output.json

# Single challenge
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --runs 1 --challenges arch-001

# Specific skill (always includes baseline for comparison)
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --skill megamind-deep --runs 3

# Financial skill only
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --skill megamind-financial --runs 2

# Compare against saved baseline
python3 tools/run_benchmark.py --runs 5 --save results/new.json --compare results/old.json
```

## Review Process

A tiered review-orchestration skill that turns scattered reviewers into a disciplined workflow. Default-on in `setup.py init`; activates on `/review-process` or whenever a change/decision/PR is about to be reviewed.

> **Rollout note for existing projects.** `review-process` is in the `always_on` set, so it auto-appears on the next `/update-foundry` even if it's missing from a stale manifest. The skill is dormant until invoked — adding the files costs ~30 KB on disk and zero runtime overhead until you use `/review-process`. To remove it, delete `.claude/skills/review-process/` and `.claude/commands/review-process.md` after the update; foundry will re-add them on the run after that unless you also remove it from `always_on` in `tools/setup.py`. If this default-on behavior is unwanted, file an issue and we'll move it to a normal opt-in toggle.

### What it adds

- **Risk tiers T0–T4** — mechanical → normal → integrated → high-risk → release/post-incident
- **Review modes** — `AUDIT_ONLY`, `FIX_AUTHORIZED`, `FIX_AND_COMMIT_AUTHORIZED`
- **Model strategies** — `SINGLE_FAST`, `DIVERSE_STANDARD`, `PREMIUM_TARGETED`, `MIXED_PREMIUM`, `USER_SPECIFIED`
- **Reviewer routing** — triggers map to existing foundry reviewers (`megamind-*` skills + `code-reviewer-*`, `security-reviewer-*`, `tdd-guide-*`, `architect-*`, `refactor-cleaner-*`, `build-error-resolver-*` agents)
- **Finding ledger** — every finding gets severity, confidence, evidence strength, disposition, and prevention action
- **Reviewer compaction** — at most one reviewer per concern; adversarial covers cross-concern interactions
- **Persistent review state** — recurring findings, converted checks, deferrals, and accepted risks live in the project at `docs/review-state/log.md` (seeded on first use from the skill's templates)

### Layered sub-files (additive)

| File | Applies to |
|------|-----------|
| `SKILL.md` | Canonical entry — shared tiers/modes/routing/ledger/state |
| `general.md` | Non-software decisions, plans, documents, policies |
| `software.md` | Any-language code change (smells, omissions, architecture, tests) |
| `python.md` | Python code, packaging, scripts, libraries |
| `python-non-gui.md` | Python CLI/service/worker/library |
| `python-gui.md` | PySide6/PyQt/Qt desktop GUI (references `gui-threading` + `python-qt-gui` skills) |

Always start with the general process and add every more-specific sub-file whose trigger applies.

### Relationship to other foundry artifacts

- Complements `pr-review-toolkit` (which reviews already-created PRs) — this skill governs pre-commit / pre-PR review.
- Complements the `code-review` plugin (single-shot review) — this skill is a tiered governance process.
- Routes work to skills/agents foundry already ships; if a referenced reviewer isn't installed, the review header records it as unavailable.

## Copilot CLI

Foundry no longer ships a VS Code extension or MCP bridge for Copilot. With the
GitHub Copilot CLI installed locally, reaching non-Claude models is trivial — a
single `copilot -p` invocation — so the bridge, its 7 `/copilot-*` skills, and
the per-workspace runtime gymnastics were retired in favour of a thin reference
skill.

The `copilot-cli` skill (auto-installed, like `review-process`) documents the
one canonical call:

```bash
copilot -p "<prompt>" --model <model> --allow-all-tools -s
```

- **Prerequisite:** the `copilot` GitHub Copilot CLI on `PATH`, authenticated
  (`copilot` once interactively to sign in). Verify with `copilot --version`.
- **Token cost:** spends your GitHub Copilot subscription, not Anthropic tokens.
- **Primary consumer:** `review-process` references it to run a second,
  cross-model reviewer (e.g. `gpt-5.4`) under the `DIVERSE_STANDARD` strategy.
  If `copilot` is not installed, review-process falls back to a second Claude
  run automatically — the CLI is an enhancement, never a hard dependency.

See `skills/copilot-cli/SKILL.md` for the full invocation contract and model
notes. There is no installer, no MCP server, and nothing to enable per
workspace — if `copilot` runs in your shell, it works.

## Project Management

Named project contexts let you juggle multiple parallel initiatives without losing state between sessions. Each project lives in `.claude/prjs/<name>.md` — a simple markdown file with YAML frontmatter tracking goal, status, decisions, key files, and the last Claude session ID.

### Workflow

```
/prj-new bank-refactor          # Create project, open file for editing
/prj-pause bank-refactor        # Save state (records current session_id)
/prj-list                       # See all projects, their status, resume commands
/prj-resume bank-refactor       # Reload context — suggests `claude --resume <id>`
/prj-done bank-refactor         # Mark complete
/prj-delete bank-refactor       # Remove
```

### Project file

A project file looks like:

```markdown
---
name: bank-refactor
status: active            # active | paused | done
updated: 2026-04-04T14:22
session_id: abc123...     # Set on /prj-pause
---

## Goal
Migrate the legacy /api/accounts endpoints to the new service.

## Status
- [x] Inventoried existing callers
- [ ] Draft compatibility shim
- [ ] Migration plan

## Decisions
- Use adapter pattern rather than parallel rewrite

## Key Files
- src/api/accounts.py
- tests/test_accounts.py

## Resume
What to pick up next session...
```

### How session tracking works

On `/prj-pause`, the script records the current Claude session ID into the project file via the shared `skills/_lib/session-id.sh` library (it reads `.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/` to find the active session JSONL). On `/prj-resume`, the skill reads it back and suggests `claude --resume <session_id>` so you can continue the exact same conversation — or start a fresh session with full project context loaded.

### When to use this vs `/snapshot`

| Feature | Use `/prj-*` | Use `/snapshot` |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Long-lived named initiative | ✓ | |
| Running multiple projects in parallel | ✓ | |
| Point-in-time session capture | | ✓ |
| Stateful session resumption by ID | ✓ | |
